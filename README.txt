Mini LD #31: "Fear" - Jan. 21-22, 2012

Controls:
Left-click to summon a ghost.  The ghost will rise and say "BOO", thus scaring nearby people.  When a person has too much fear, they become a ghost, which increases your available ghosts.

To win, turn everyone into a ghost.  Try to aim for the lowest "Time" or "Ghosts summoned" score!
